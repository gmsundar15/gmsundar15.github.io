I am a Research Assistant at the Welding and Additive Manufacturing Centre at Cranfield University, UK. My specialisation lies in the field of process modelling and simulations, specifically in the Finite Element Method (FEM). Apart from developing models, I have a keen interest in scientific computing, writing code for numerical solvers and mathematical modelling of materials.

My hobbies include photography, playing retro games and contributing to open source. I like reading non-fiction and listening to metal, ambient and electronic music.
